## Ethics

The strength of the university depends on academic and personal
integrity. In this course, you must be honest and truthful, abiding by
the *Computer Science Academic Integrity Policy*:

> Cheating is wrong. Cheating hurts our community by undermining academic
> integrity, creating mistrust, and fostering unfair competition. The
> university will punish cheaters with failure on an assignment,
> failure in a course, permanent transcript notation, suspension, and/or
> expulsion. Offenses may be reported to medical, law or other professional
> or graduate schools when a cheater applies.
> 
> Violations can include cheating on exams, plagiarism, reuse of assignments
> without permission, improper use of the Internet and electronic devices,
> unauthorized collaboration, alteration of graded assignments, forgery
> and falsification, lying, facilitating academic dishonesty, and unfair
> competition. Ignorance of these rules is not an excuse.
> 
> Academic honesty is required in all work you submit to be graded. Except
> where the instructor specifies group work, you must solve all homework and
> programming assignments without the help of others. For example, you must
> not look at anyone else’s solutions (including program code) to your
> homework problems. However, you may discuss assignment specifications
> (not solutions) with others to be sure you understand what is required
> by the assignment.
> 
> If your instructor permits using fragments of source code from outside
> sources, such as your textbook or on-line resources, you must properly
> cite the source. Not citing it constitutes plagiarism. Similarly, your
> group projects must list everyone who participated.
> 
> Falsifying program output or results is prohibited.
> 
> Your instructor is free to override parts of this policy for particular
> assignments. To protect yourself: (1) Ask the instructor if you are not
> sure what is permissible. (2) Seek help from the instructor, TA or CAs,
> as you are always encouraged to do, rather than from other students. (3)
> Cite any questionable sources of help you may have received.
> 
> On every exam, you will sign the following pledge: "I agree to complete
> this exam without unauthorized assistance from any person, materials or
> device. [Signed and dated]". Your course instructors will let you know
> where to find copies of old exams, if they are available.

Report any violations you witness to the instructor.

## Classroom Climate

I am committed to creating a classroom environment that values the diversity of experiences and perspectives that all students bring. Everyone here has the right to be treated with dignity and respect. I believe fostering an inclusive climate is important because research and my experience show that students who interact with peers who are different from themselves learn new things and experience tangible educational outcomes. Please join me in creating a welcoming and vibrant classroom climate. Note that you should expect to be challenged intellectually by me, the TAs, and your peers, and at times this may feel uncomfortable. Indeed, it can be helpful to be pushed sometimes in order to learn and grow. But at no time in this learning process should someone be singled out or treated unequally on the basis of any seen or unseen part of their identity.

If you ever have concerns in this course about
harassment, discrimination, or any unequal treatment, or if you seek
accommodations or resources, I invite you to share directly with me or
the TAs. I promise that we will take your communication seriously and
to seek mutually acceptable resolutions and accommodations. Reporting
will never impact your course grade. You may also share concerns with
the Department Head (Randal Burns,
[randal@cs.jhu.edu](mailto:randal@cs.jhu.edu)),
the Director of Undergraduate Studies (Joanne Selinski,
[joanne@cs.jhu.edu](mailto:joanne@cs.jhu.edu)), the Assistant
Dean for Diversity and Inclusion (Darlene Saporu,
[dsaporu@jhu.edu](mailto:dsaporu@jhu.edu)), or
the Office of Institutional Equity ([oie@jhu.edu](mailto:oie@jhu.edu)). In handling reports,
people will protect your privacy as much as possible, but faculty
and staff are required to officially report information for some cases
(e.g. sexual harassment).
