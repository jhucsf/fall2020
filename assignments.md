# Assignments

This page lists the programming assignments for the course.

Some advice about the programming assignments:

* They are *individual* assignments
* Do not wait until the last minute to start: if we give you two weeks to complete an assignment, it's because we expect that it will take you two weeks (working steadily)
* Ask questions on [Piazza](https://piazza.com/jhu/spring2020/601229) and in office hours
* Use good programming practices
* Test your code thoroughly (plan to spend about as much time testing the code as writing it)

Please read the [style guidelines](assign/style.html) so that you know what our coding style expectations are.
